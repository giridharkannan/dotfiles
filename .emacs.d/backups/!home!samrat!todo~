* Polish up your Git skills. Stay focussed on Git now, try Mercurial later.

* Do lots of Clojure. Read Clojure books. 4Clojure. Project Euler. You name it.

* Start looking at open source projects. Both Python and Clojure.
* Then start sending those pull requests.

* Start gently going through Khan Academy lessons. Try Linear Algebra first.

* Also, learn Noir and more Clojure stuff. 
* Start doing a lot of projects. A lot.
